# LED Blinker – Arduino Projects 💡

This repository contains simple Arduino sketches to understand the basics of **LED blinking**.  
It starts with the internal LED on the Arduino board and extends to controlling external LEDs.

## 🚀 Projects Included

### 1. Blink Internal LED
- Uses the **built-in LED** on the Arduino board (usually pin 13).  
- LED turns ON and OFF with a delay.  
- Perfect “Hello World” for Arduino.

### 2. Blink Two External LEDs (Together)
- Connect two LEDs to different GPIO pins.  
- Both LEDs blink **at the same time**.

### 3. Blink Two External LEDs (Alternating)
- Two LEDs blink **one after another**.  
- Great for understanding digital output control.
